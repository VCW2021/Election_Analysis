Overview of Election Audit:
The purpose of this election analysis audit is to find out which county is the largest based off of votes. In module 3 we learned how to read and use csv files in python and run the data we got to get a result. The data file has 4 differeng sections, when searching through the date information of all of the candidates came up with many votes for each candidate had recieved. The result was than writen in a text file. 

Election audit results:

Election Audit Summary:
Looking at  the results our script shows effectivly how to find vote counts, percentage of votes won by each county and candidate were good and even greater assuming we could figure out what the percentages of each county voted for each candidate. If we add an if statement unnder line 76 that could give us more on what counties voted for who. Because this could gives us a bigger picture of counties or even states if the data was different, this is something we could possibly use in the future.
